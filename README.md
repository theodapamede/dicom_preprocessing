# DICOM Preprocessing for Medical Imaging

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing various medical imaging modalities in DICOM format. It's designed to support lectures and practical work in medical image analysis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders, each corresponding to a specific lecture:

1. `cxr_data_preprocessing/`: Preprocessing techniques for Chest X-rays
2. `embed_data_preprocessing/`: Preprocessing methods for breast imaging modalities
   - Mammograms
   - Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)
   - Breast MRIs

## Contents

Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various preprocessing techniques specific to the imaging modality. These may include:

- Presentation State Transformations
- Image normalization
- Noise reduction
- Contrast enhancement
- Segmentation

## Getting Started
